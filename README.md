# Simple-Group-Chat-Application-
Several network systems are built to communicate with one another as well as made available through service-oriented architectures. In this project, the client server architecture is used to develop a chat application. Firstly a chat application is created for both Client and Server which is based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) where TCP is connection oriented protocol and is a reliable connection protocol​ . ​ The design is very simple. It is implemented in java, since is easy to program in,it precludes the need to deal with low-level memory management and includes powerful libraries for sockets and threads.
